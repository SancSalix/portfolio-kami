title: Getting My Start
---

I got started with programming because I was very bored at my accounting job, there wasn't enough work to keep me occupied, and I was frustrated by the limitations of the tools I had. Those tools were mainly the ERP I used (SAP at that time) and Microsoft Excel. So very limited.

To save time and effort, I created an invoice generator for some internal business units I was cross charging. Very simple, it merely captured a certain area, and created a pdf every time I clicked a button.

A co-worker saw this and liked it. He asked for one of his own. However, he wanted one of vastly different scope. He wanted his to be automated, to scrape the data out of forecasted templates, create new templates, and add all the data to an ever growing database. He wanted it locked down for editing when operations people used it, he wanted a way to implement static cost changes, the ability to edit templates, the list went on and on. 

My co-worker was also very exacting. He had a long list of must-haves, and wouldn't budge on a single one. A lot of times I thought something was impossible, I would spend researching and cobbling together different bits of things I had learned, to learn I was wrong and learn a lot in the process.  

All the while I was learning new types of VB, learning it again when I was forced to move to Access, and realizing that the struggle and completion of a programming challenge was far more satisfying than accounting had ever been.

Once I realized this, it was like a curtain had parted. I started looking for a new job, because I knew my current role couldn't expand to fit my newfound programming urges. I was lucky enough to find a role at a local (and locally famous) software developer. The role was for a position that was half accountant/half sys admin. So much closer! I was also allowed a lot more freedom in my ability to explore and try things out. I spent a year learning SQL and testing the limits and if my new passion would last.

It not only lasted, it grew. I wanted more than databases and reports. I wanted to be able to create things, to see complicated nests of code make something beautiful. I had a goal and I was driven to pursue it. It was a relief to me to find work that satisfied, after the frustration of working in accounting.

So! I started because I didn't want to save every invoice individually, and that was the best happy accident for me. 

*Also I'd prefer to never have to use VB ever again.*
