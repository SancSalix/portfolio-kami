One of the biggest troubles I've had with attempting to shift my career and learn programming has been centered around tools. Which IDE to use? How do I upload things? Where/how do I preview what I'm building? Which languages do I want to learn?

I was embarrassed to ask in the beginning some of the stuff I assumed would be simple. Most resources either had internal little coding windows to attempt what they were teaching, or were just examples and how-tos. Googling ususually ended up at Stack Overflow with a million voices shouting. 

The choice for IDE is a lot of personal preference mixed with whatever people have to use at work, but I had no experience with any of them, and didn't want to choose one that would be *too* helpful and prevent me from learning. Random googling proved overwhelming. The best results I had were from asking developers their favorite and giving those a try.  

After that, how did I actually *see* what I was making? HTML was simple enough, but where was I going to test the functionality of my other scripts? That was where a simple google was enough, and I ended up enjoying [JSBin](https://jsbin.com/?html,output) for simple checks.

More complicated projects though needed more sophisticated preview methods. I learned the rightness of version control, and the ease of GitHub (after some minor struggles setting up my command line) meant I now had GitHub pages. A blessing to see the websites I had built! My first time launching the site I had been working on was something of a revelation. The code I had written was making links fire, actions happen, images show, and it existed in a real space.

Languages are still something I waver between, besides the ones mandated by my bootcamp. Choices like Python, Java, Go, C , or Ruby. Each used for different types of work. I feel more confident as I go along, and I also know I can always learn another as I find my strengths. That doesn't mean there aren't a million choices though! I mostly spy on other developer conversations scattered across the internet, and take personal note. This person says Ruby on Rails is dying, this person loves React, it all forms a web of awareness. The other thing I learned was useful was to look at job postings. If it was needed, it was requested. The most used languages became familiar after a day of combing through a variety of openings.

I'm less embarrassed to ask now, but that's also because instead of a babe in the woods, I am ever so slightly more knowledgeable. The world of programming still seems vast to my eyes.
